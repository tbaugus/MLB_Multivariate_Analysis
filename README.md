# Multivariate Analysis: MLB Hitting Statistics (2023)

## Project Overview
This project applies multivariate statistical techniques to 2023 MLB hitting data to identify patterns in player performance. It was completed as part of a Graduate-level Multivariate Analysis course.

## Analysis Techniques for my contributions:
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to simplify complex performance metrics. This analysis can be found in the Word doc on pages 7-16.

## Analysis Techniques Used by teammates:
* **Data Cleaning & EDA:** Handling outliers and missing values in seasonal hitting stats.
* **Clustering Analysis:** Grouping players into performance tiers based on hitting profiles.
* **Factor Analysis:** Identifying underlying variables that drive offensive success.

## Tools
* **R:** Statistical computing and data visualization.
* **Excel:** Initial data organization.
